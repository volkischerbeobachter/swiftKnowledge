Welcome back everyone, something very interesting just came out, a person posted on Reddit yesterday that your device can actually become a little bit faster if you actually change a specific setting, here’s a link to this Reddit post:

Here’s the thing, I’m not talking about turning off low power mode, turning off background notifications, or background app refresh, this method is a little bit different, this method requires changing your region. Here’s the thing, Apple had a controversy a few years ago revolving around the throttling of iPhone performance, this essentially slowed your iPhone down if you’re iPhone battery health was below a certain level:

Well, apparently a few places in the world actually fought against this, so if you change your iPhone’s region to this specific area, you will essentially be eliminating the throttling, so what is this specific region? It’s France! So, how do you change your iPhone region to France? Here is the process:

Start off by opening up your iPhone settings:

Click on language and region:

Now click region and change it to France:

Your iPhone may or may not reboot, but your device should now have the throttling disabled, but here is the most important thing to keep in mind: this only speeds up your iPhone if your iPhone was throttling, if it wasn’t throttling, you shouldn’t be experiencing this issue.

That’s pretty much it! if you guys have any other questions let me know in the comment section as well, more importantly than everything else I love every single one of you, hopefully, I’ll catch you in the next article!
