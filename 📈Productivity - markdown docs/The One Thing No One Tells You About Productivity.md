We live in a world that is obsessed with productivity. We’re all looking for ways to fill every minute of our day with something that feels productive, often linking productivity with our self-worth. Struggling to do more, to do better.

Naturally, there are hundreds of articles out there on how one can be more productive, get things done, work smarter, come up with more ideas. There’s one thing however, that people fail to mention about productivity: having too many ideas can actually kill it.

# The More Ideas You Have, the Less Focused You Are

When a client gives you a project, you have specific instructions and guidelines about what to write, how to write it, and how to format it. But when you have your own blog or simply write for a writing platform like Medium, you’re creating your own content.

What does this mean? That you’re the one who has to come up with good, creative, attractive ideas. I’m a person whose mind is constantly filled with ideas. And that’s something that used to bring me a lot of trouble.

Now, here’s a girl — that’s me — saying that having many ideas is bad. You might be thinking that I’m ungrateful, silly, or something in between. That’s because most people believe that the more ideas one has, the better. I’m here to tell you that that’s far from the truth.

I used to have *so many ideas* filling my mind, zooming around in my head. The result? I found myself in a dead-end. That’s because all of these ideas made me lose my focus. I didn’t know which one to choose, which one to invest in.

Instead of focusing on one idea, investing in it, and perfecting it, I used to spend hours examining each and every one of them, analyzing them in detail, and comparing them.

The takeaway is, the more ideas you have, the less focused you will be.

# Having Too Many Ideas Can Actually Decrease Your Productivity

One would think that with so many ideas, I would be writing, like, 10 articles a day. What was really happening is I often ended up not writing for many days in a row, because I couldn’t decide *what* to write on.

On the other hand, sometimes my brain got so tired of all these thoughts and ideas dancing around in my head, that it kind of shut down. That meant another couple of days that I couldn’t write anything due to my mental fatigue.

So, as you can see, instead of helping me increase my productivity, my precious ideas actually made me_less_ productive.

The takeaway? You don’t need to be in a constant pursuit of new ideas to be more productive. If you have a couple of them, it’s enough. Even one good idea can be explored in many different ways.

# How to Manage Your Ideas

I must say that my mind is *still* filled with a lot of ideas. The difference with the past is that now I’ve learned to managed them, put them in order, and use them to my advantage.

If you’re having trouble managing your ideas or deciding which one of them is best, here are some things that could help you:

   ### Capture your thoughts and ideas on paper

Writing down your ideas not only is very liberating, but it makes it easier to examine them and make a wise choice. You know, it’s like seeing a dress on a photo, and actually wearing it on.

   ### Do not second guess your choices

One of the most silly things I did, was to second guess my choice, every time I had settled on an idea of mine. *But maybe it’s not that good after all?* *Would it be best to develop that other one? On second thought, there are some issues with the current one.*

This kind of thoughts were filling my mind. And they were *frustrating.* If you want to avoid mental fatigue and severe burnout, it would be best to not second guess your choices.

   ### Ask a friend’s opinion

Let’s be honest with this one. We often let our ego cloud our judgment. Yes, you might have a great ton of ideas, but are they good? Are they unique? Sharing your thoughts with a friend or anyone close to you could help you exclude some not-so-great ideas and invest in the worthy ones.
