I decided to go for a long run this past weekend and was determined to hit double digits. The weather was supposed to be perfect, I didn’t have anything else on the docket for that day, and I had just taken a few days off to recover from dose two of the COVID vaccine. I was feeling all primed to go.

But, of course, things don’t always go to plan.

Before setting out on my run, I grabbed my new sunglasses since it was supposed to be particularly bright out. I also put on my mask, because I don’t feel comfortable running without one with so many people roaming around Boston.

If you’ve ever run or walked with a mask and sunglasses, you’ve probably experienced the issue I found myself facing at the very start of my run: incessant fogging. I spent the first half mile of my run trying to position my sunglasses on just the right part of my nose, to no avail. I spent the second half mile of my run deciding whether to wear my sunglasses versus my mask on my face, based on the amount of oncoming foot traffic. And yes, I probably should have turned around from the start to ditch the glasses. But there’s a stubborn, hopeful part of me that wanted everything to work out.

Spoiler alert: It didn’t.

A couple of miles in, I had already exhausted myself with the constant switching back and forth and felt my ears strain with the pressure of holding my sunglasses, mask, earbuds, and headband, so I pulled over to the side of the path to regroup. I hitched my sunglasses to my running belt and made the resolution to start fresh.

Once I started jogging again, I began to feel off. My whole body felt heavy and tired, and every stride felt slower than the last. I kept checking my Garmin to see what my pace was, and was disappointed each time, leading me to pick it up to an unsustainable new speed and then drop off even slower than before.

This magnetism to the watch sucked up my energy — and my joy — through the miles, and once I got to mile seven of 10, I was ready to call it quits.

I saw one of my favorite spots in the North End up ahead, so I pulled off to try to salvage the run. If it’s going to suck, at least it can suck by the water, right?

I decided to take a breather and sit on a harborside bench tucked away from the road. I welcomed the quiet. I changed my playlist from my usual loud beat drops to “Indie Sunshine” on Spotify. And I told myself that I could finish this out, as long as I allowed my body to take it at the pace it needs. My main goal was the distance anyway. I didn’t need to add the extra pressure of meeting some imaginary speed goal too.

I buckled my running belt one more time as I started in again, and dug deep to finish it out. Three miles later, I reached the 10 miles I had been shooting for.

So, although the run didn’t necessarily go the way that I wanted it to, I’m proud of myself for getting it done and taking the power back. Speed isn’t the metric that I use to define my run’s success, although it’s a nice-to-have. The run is a good one as long as I’m able to leap over the mental hurdles in my way.
